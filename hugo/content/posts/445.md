Hi there, 
Sorry for the wait.
I’ll be happy to get that account closed for you. For security purposes, can you please confirm two of the following?
• The current verification balance (you can find this on your account dashboard here: https://app.kickbox.com/verify/dashboard)
• The last invoice amount and date (you can find this by clicking here: https://app.kickbox.com/settings/invoices)
• The name of an API instance(you can find this here: https://app.kickbox.com/verify/api)
• The title and date of the last uploaded file/list (You can find your lists here: https://app.kickbox.com/verify/lists)
Once that is confirmed, I can closed that out right away.

Hi there, I also sorry for the wait. I confirmed all of these. I don't have any problem to close my account. Could you close it?

> • The last invoice amount and date (you can find this by clicking here: 
No invoices found.
> • The name of an API instance(you can find this here:

Not a problem.
