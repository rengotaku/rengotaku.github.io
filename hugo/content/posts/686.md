# Resolution
[Nested ActiveRecord transaction pitfalls - makandra dev](https://makandracards.com/makandra/42885-nested-activerecord-transaction-pitfalls)

Recoomend to use below:
```
ActiveRecord::Base.transaction(joinable: false, requires_new: true)
```

> joinable: false means transactions nested within this transaction will not be discarded (and therefore not be joined to the custom transaction). A real nested transaction will be used, or, if the DBMS does not support nested transaction, this behaviour will be simulated with Savepoints (this is done for MySQL and Postgres).

> If a custom transaction lives inside another transaction, which we can not control, we can use ActiveRecord::Base.transaction(requires_new: true) to force a real (or simulated) nested transaction and avoid joining with the parent transaction.

[ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::DatabaseStatements](https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/DatabaseStatements.html#method-i-transaction)

## Adtionals
If you want to act as atomic just using `ActiveRecord::Rollback`, you have to raise without it.
```
ApplicationRecord.transaction do
  User.create!(name: "first")
  ApplicationRecord.transaction(joinable: false, requires_new: true) do
    User.create!(name: "second")
    raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
  end
end
```
Only first is saved.

```
ApplicationRecord.transaction do
  User.create!(name: "first")
  ApplicationRecord.transaction(joinable: false, requires_new: true) do
    User.create!(name: "second")
    raise
  end
end
```
no saved.
