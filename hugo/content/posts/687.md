# Resolution
[Rails 5 Routes: Scope vs Namespace - Devblast](https://devblast.com/b/rails-5-routes-scope-vs-namespace)
```rb
  namespace :service do
    scope :v1 do
      resource :product do
        get "/", to: "v1/product#hoge"
```

# Motivation
If don't expect not to change some APIs behavior even its version increase, you should use `scoep` instead of `namespace`.
```rb
  namespace :service do
    namespace :v1 do
      resource :product do
        get "/", to: "product#hoge"
```
Generated path is `service_v1_product GET	/service/v1/product(.:format)	service/v1/product#hoge`.
