# Resolution
Intended in [Avoiding MySQL ALTER table downtime](https://www.percona.com/blog/2014/11/18/avoiding-mysql-alter-table-downtime/).
In my case of runnning 5.6, I can use `..., ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE`. In details [MySQL :: MySQL 5.6 Reference Manual :: 14.13.1 Online DDL Operations](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-online-ddl-operations.html).

But according to [MySQL create index with LOCK=NONE still locks a table - Database Administrators Stack Exchange](https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/138368), you can't this way.
