```
Give me an example of a mixin
The module Comparable provides a variety of comparison operators (<, <=, ==, >=, >, between?). It defines these in terms of calls to the general comparison method, <=>. However, it does not itself define <=>.

Say you want to create a class where comparisons are based on the number of legs an animal has:

class Animal
  include Comparable

  attr_reader :legs

  def initialize(name, legs)
    @name, @legs = name, legs
  end

  def <=>(other)
    legs <=> other.legs
  end

  def inspect
    @name
  end
end

c = Animal.new("cat", 4)
s = Animal.new("snake", 0)
p = Animal.new("parrot", 2)

c < s             # => false
s < c             # => true
p >= s            # => true
p.between?(s, c)  # => true
[p, s, c].sort    # => [snake, parrot, cat]
```
